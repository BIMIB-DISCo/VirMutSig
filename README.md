VirMutSig
================

VirMutSig is a computational tool to perform mutational signatures analysis from sequencing data obtained from SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes. The tool provides a set of functions to support the users for sequencing data retrieval and alignment and to perform de novo mutational signatures inference and assignment.

For details on the use of our tool, please refer to Graudenzi, Alex, et al. "Mutational signatures and heterogeneous host response revealed via large-scale characterization of SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity." Iscience 24.2 (2021): 102116.

Please feel free to contact us if you have problems running our tool at daniele.ramazzotti1@gmail.com, alex.graudenzi@ibfm.cnr.it or d.maspero@campus.unimib.it.
