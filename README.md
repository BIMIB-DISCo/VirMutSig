VirMutSig
================

VirMutSig is a computational tool to perform mutational signatures analysis from sequencing data obtained from SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes. The tool provides a set of functions to support the users for sequencing data retrieval and alignment and to perform de novo mutational signatures inference and assignment.

The VirMutSig protocol is available at: Maspero, D. et al. "VirMutSig: Discovery and assignment of viral mutational signatures from sequencing data", STAR Protocols 2.4 (2021): 100911. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xpro.2021.100911

For details on the theoretical framework, please refer to: Graudenzi, A., et al. "Mutational signatures and heterogeneous host response revealed via large-scale characterization of SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity" Iscience 24.2 (2021): 102116. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2021.102116

Please feel free to contact us if you have problems running our tool at: d.maspero@campus.unimib.it and daniele.ramazzotti@unimib.it.


Highlights
===============
• Distinct mutational processes underlie the origination of viral variants

• VirMutSig implements variant calling from raw sequencing data of viral genomes

• The tool performs de novo discovery of mutational signatures (substitution patterns)

• Robust assignment of signature activity to samples is performed via bootstrap
