VirMutSig
================

VirMutSig is a computational tool to perform mutational signatures analysis from sequencing data obtained from SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes. The tool provide a set of script to support the users during (a) sequencing data retrieval and alignment; b) performing de novo mutational signatures inference and c) performing assignment and statistical evaluation of predefine signatures. 

For details on the use of our tool, please refer to Graudenzi, Alex, et al. "Mutational signatures and heterogeneous host response revealed via large-scale characterization of SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity." Iscience 24.2 (2021): 102116.
